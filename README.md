# sgu10adapters
3d part models to adapt SGU10 lamp fixtures to work with normal GU10 lamps.

There are generally two parts, the SGU10 to GU10 adapter part and the 50mm to 63mm face ring adapter.

For the SGU10 to GU10 adapter, I recommend using the invertedsepco.stl design. All the rings are more or less the same.. the ringnarrow50.stl is the latest and slightly tighter but they all work fine.

A word of warning - do not print the electrical adapter part using carbon fiber as it is electrically conductive! Use non-conductive plastic filaments only.

to assemble it you need some hardware in addition to the 3d printed parts;
for each unit you will need

  * A GU10 socket (https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00K2TJ4I8/)
  * Two 12mm M3 slotted plastic cutting screws (https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/M2-M2-3-M2-6-M3-Pan-Head-Phillips-PT-Slotted-Self-tapping-Screws-Tail-Cut-Screws/202177180586?)
  * Two hex standoffs 10mm, I prefer nickel ones (https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Hex-Spacer-Standoff-M3x10-Nickel-Brass-Harwin-R30-1001002-Pk20/153541310597)
  * Two standard M3 5mm machine screws (https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/M3-3mm-A2-STAINLESS-STEEL-POZI-PAN-HEAD-MACHINE-SCREWS-POZIDRIVE-BOLTS-UK/111304543360?)
  * Two GU10 pins -- or maybe substitute another M3 machine screw (https://www.yoycart.com/Product/587235273486/Pure_copper_tinned_bile_machine_stereo_D)


The GU10 pins are hard to find.. another source may be taobao; https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=587235273486 way easier to order from yoycart though.

Assembly instructions:

  1) Cut GU10 socket wires to 4.5cm and skin off 4mm of insulation.
  2) Insert the bare ends of the wires into the hole in the side of the hexagonal supports inside the adapter.
  3) Insert the 10mm hex standoff into the hex holes in the bottom and push it in until it crimps the wires.
  4) Screw the 5mm M3 machine screw through the hole in the top of the hex support into the hex standoff inside.
  5) Screw the GU10 socket into the two round support pillars using the 12mm M3 plastic cutting screws.
  6) Screw the GU10 pins into the bottom of the hex standoff.


Cost estimates:

15.65 / 60 * 2 = £0.52  (GU10 pins)
8.46 / 20 * 1  = £0.42  (GU10 socket)
1.20 / 20 * 2  = £0.13  (M3 12mm tail slotted plastic screw)
2.80 / 20 * 2  = £0.28  (10mm FF hex standoff)
1.79 / 20 * 2  = £0.18  (M3 5mm screw)

Total:           £1.53 per adapter

Add to that the cost of the 3d printing.. if you can get access to a 3d printer and just pay for the filament that'd be best.

Ordering from makeitquick.com;

invertedsepco.stl in white PC-ABS 80% fill £7.19 per unit
ringnarrow50.stl in white PC-ABS 20% fill  £3.16 per unit
